**Privacy Policy for .djzx's Discord Bot**

**Last Updated:** [4/26/2025]

This Privacy Policy describes how .djzx ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our Discord bot (the ".djzx's Discord Bot" or the "Bot").

**.1. Information We Collect**

We collect the following types of information from users of the Bot:

* **Discord User Information:** To provide the Bot's features, we collect your Discord User ID, username, and nickname(s).
* **Discord Server Information:** We collect the Discord Server ID and name where the Bot is used.
* **Leveling Data:** We collect and store your XP and level progression.
* **Voice Channel Data (Temporary):** When you participate in voice channels, we temporarily track your join and leave times to calculate and award XP. This data is generally not stored long-term once the XP is awarded.
* **XP-Game Data:** When you participate in XP-based games, we may collect data related to your participation and outcomes (e.g., whether you won or lost, XP earned).
* **Moderator Actions:** We may log actions taken by server moderators using the Bot's administrative commands (e.g., adding/removing users, setting the level-up channel).

**.2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

* **Providing Bot Functionality:** To operate the leveling system, award XP, track levels, and facilitate XP-based games.
* **Level-Up Notifications:** To send level-up messages in the designated server channel.
* **Leaderboard Functionality:** To display server leaderboards based on user XP and levels.
* **Bot Administration:** To manage and improve the Bot's performance and features.
* **Support:** To provide support and address user inquiries.
* **Enforcing Terms of Service:** To monitor and enforce our Terms of Service, including preventing cheating or misuse of the Bot.

**.3. Sharing of Your Information**

We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:

* **Within the Discord Server:** Information such as usernames, nicknames, and leveling data (including leaderboard rankings) may be visible to other members of the Discord server where the Bot is used.
* **With Server Moderators:** Server moderators may have access to user data through the Bot's administrative commands for the purpose of managing the Bot and the server's community.
* **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request.
* **Service Providers (If Applicable):** If we use third-party service providers to help us operate the Bot (e.g., for database hosting), they may have access to your information to perform services on our behalf, but they will be obligated to protect it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. **[Note: Based on your current `index.js` and schemas, you seem to be directly managing your database. If this changes, you'll need to update this section.]**

**.4. Data Retention**

We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Bot's functionality and as outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. For example, leveling data is generally retained as long as a user is part of a server using the Bot to maintain their progress. Temporary voice channel data is typically deleted shortly after processing.

**.5. Your Rights**

Depending on your location and applicable data protection laws, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data. To exercise these rights, please contact us on Discord at `.djzx`. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable laws.

**.6. Children's Privacy**

The Bot is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or other applicable age of consent in your jurisdiction). If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.

**.7. Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no internet or electronic transmission is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**.8. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on our GitHub repository [You will need to add the link here once your repository is created]. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates. Your continued use of the Bot after the posting of revised Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes.

**.9. Contact Us**

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us on Discord at `.djzx`.
