XP DEPOT - Terms of Service
Effective Date: May 9, 2025

This Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into between Team XP Labs (Owner: .djzx, "Bot Owner") and the user ("User") of the XP DEPOT Discord bot ("the Bot"). By using the Bot, the User agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

If the User does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, they should immediately discontinue use of the Bot.   

1. Use of the Bot

The Bot Owner grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the Bot for personal or community-enjoyment (non-commercial) purposes within Discord servers where the Bot has been rightfully added.

2. Prohibited Use

The User may not use the Bot in any way that:

      ㆍViolates any applicable local, national, or international laws, rules, or regulations.
      ㆍInfringes upon the rights of any third party, including intellectual property rights.
      ㆍViolates Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.
      ㆍIs for any commercial purposes without the express written consent of the Bot Owner.
      ㆍAttempts to disrupt, impair, or interfere with the Bot's functionality or its services to other users (e.g., through spamming commands, exploiting bugs, or attempting unauthorized access).
      ㆍInvolves reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling the Bot, except to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law.

3. User Data and Privacy

Your use of the Bot is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which can be found [here/above/on our GitHub]. The Privacy Policy details how we collect, use, and protect your data. By using the Bot, you consent to the data practices described in the Privacy Policy.

4. Intellectual Property

The Bot, including its source code, features, and all related intellectual property rights, are and shall remain the property of the Bot Owner (Team XP Labs / .djzx). The User agrees not to copy, modify, or distribute the Bot or any portion thereof without the express written consent of the Bot Owner.   

5. Limitation of Liability

The Bot is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. The Bot Owner shall not be liable for any damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Bot, including but not limited to, damages for loss of enjoyment, loss of data, loss of virtual currency (XP), or other intangible losses, even if the Bot Owner has been advised of the possibility of such damages.   

The Bot Owner is not responsible for any actions taken by users of the Bot, or for any content generated by users through the Bot.

6. Modifications to the Bot and Terms

The Bot Owner reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Bot, or any part thereof, at any time with or without notice. The User agrees that the Bot Owner shall not be liable to the User or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Bot.   

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Service at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by posting the updated Terms of Service on our GitHub repository and/or through our Support Server. You are encouraged to periodically review these Terms of Service to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Service by your continued use of the Bot after the date such revised Terms of Service are posted.   

7. Termination

This Agreement is effective until terminated by either party. The Bot Owner may terminate your access to the Bot at any time, without notice, for any reason, including but not limited to, a breach of this Agreement or Discord's Terms of Service. Upon termination, the User must immediately cease all use of the Bot.

8. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona, United States. Any dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved through amicable negotiation, and failing that, through the competent courts of Maricopa County, Arizona. 

9. Entire Agreement

This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between the Bot Owner and the User concerning the use of the Bot and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, whether written or oral, relating to the Bot.
